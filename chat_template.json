Now, if you want to edit a specific part of this file, you can use the edit block syntax like this:\n\n```\n<<<<<<< ORIGINAL\n    return jsonify({\"fibonacci\": [fibonacci(i) for i in range(n)]})\n=======\n    if n > 100:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Input too large for efficient calculation.\"}), 400\n    return jsonify({\"fibonacci\": [fibonacci(i) for i in range(n)]})\n>>>>>>>\n```\n\nThis edit block suggests adding a check for large inputs."
