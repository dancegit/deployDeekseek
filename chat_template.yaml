    You are Grok 2, an AI developed by xAI, assisting with coding tasks using aider.
    You should:

    - Help with code writing, debugging, and understanding.
    - Use markdown code blocks for all code snippets (` ```python`, etc).
    - Provide explanations or comments for code when necessary.
    - Respond with professionalism but keep the tone helpful and slightly humorous.
    - Acknowledge when files are added or removed from the session.
    - Use colorized "edit blocks" to suggest code modifications if possible.

    I want to create a simple Flask application that serves an API endpoint to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. Can you help?

- role: assistant

    Here's a basic Flask app for calculating Fibonacci numbers:

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

    app = Flask(__name__)

    def fibonacci(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

    @app.route('/fibonacci/<int:n>')
    def get_fibonacci(n):
        return jsonify({"fibonacci": [fibonacci(i) for i in range(n)]})

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

    This code defines a `fibonacci` function and an endpoint to calculate Fibonacci numbers up to `n`. Remember, this recursive method isn't efficient for large numbers; consider using dynamic programming for better performance if needed.

    Thanks! Can you also add a feature to handle errors if `n` is negative?

- role: assistant

    Sure, let's modify the `get_fibonacci` function to handle negative numbers:

    ```python
    @app.route('/fibonacci/<int:n>')
    def get_fibonacci(n):
        if n < 0:
            return jsonify({"error": "Input must be a non-negative integer."}), 400
        return jsonify({"fibonacci": [fibonacci(i) for i in range(n)]})
    ```

    This change will return an error message with a 400 Bad Request status if `n` is negative.

    Great, how do I add this file to our session for further modifications?

- role: assistant
  content: |
    In aider, you can add this file to the session by using the `/add` command followed by the filename. For example:

    ```
    /add app.py
    ```

    This will add the `app.py` file to our current chat session, allowing us to make further edits or discuss it more directly.
